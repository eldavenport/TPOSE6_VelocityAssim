# TPOSE6 Velocity Assimilation

This project contains analysis of intputs and outputs to/from the TPOSE6 TAO mooring assimilation. Includes validation of iter0, controls, cost function, sensitivities, etc. It also includes some model setup scripts (to generate weights for velocity priors and velocity profiles).

This analysis uses the mitgcm-assim which can be found [here](https://github.com/eldavenport/mitgcm-assim).
